# Spring Boot

## What is Spring Boot?
A Java framework that simplifies application development. There will no need for boilerplate code due to its auto-configuration.  
We hear this boilerplate thing a lot of times but what does it actually mean?
- Boilerplate codes are codes that are repeated in many places with very little differences. And Java is infamours for this because you need to write something over and over again just for a simple program to work.
- Good thing with SpringBoot is that it uses *auto-configuration* which guesses what one needs based on the libraries one includes in the project

## What is Spring Boot Used for?
Used in Web apps, REST APIs, microservices, security and cloud stuff. 

- What is this REST API thing we keep hearing about?
- *Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface* or REST API is a set of rules or standards for making a web service. 
- You can imagine it as a standardized method of programming architecture that allows everyone on different platforms to communicate with each other through the internet
