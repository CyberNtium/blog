I really wonder what people have in mind when they first became motivated to make their own blog/portfolio website.  
Do people do it for fun? Or do people do it just to show off their full stack skills?  
Or maybe it's because they saw someone else on LinkedIn doing it so now they felt left behind.  

Regardless, I don't think any of those is a sin in itself.
We live in the era of vibe-coding, the skill expression from developing something from the ground up is somehow ruined. Even for me, I rely on AI way too much for my own good.

Therefore, I'm going to rely on it lesser, by continuing with this site. I will document some of my learning journeys of various different courses. Even if there is no one reading them, I know it will be good for me,  
it **has to**.
