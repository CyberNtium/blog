_Look Back_ is a phenomenal anime released back in 2024. I had the chance to watch it in a cinema, which, albeit a little too expensive, but money well-spent because it was a **_masterpiece_**. Aside from the amazing visuals from a "slife-of-life" anime and wonderful story-telling, I simply cannot ignore one of the best parts of it for me, which is the Original Soundtrack (OST).

Directed by [_haruka nakamura_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruka_Nakamura_(composer)) and released along side the anime in 2024, this album quickly became one of easiest choices for me to pick from when I walk to campus from my dorm or moving from classes to classes. This is my first music "review" I guess, so I think I'm just going to go through some of the tracks that are special to me.

# Track 1: 流れゆく季節 - Nagareyuku kisetsu
When the movie starts, the scene starts from the moonlit sky, slowly transitioning from above until the camera pans towards the ground, showing a residential area. We then zoom into a particular house, then into the windows. Here we see a girl at her desk, fidgeting, shaking her leg, scratching her head, seemingly aggitated at doing something. After a while, we can hear pencil sketching noise, she appears to have a breakthrough and started to draw more. And then finally, she left the desk and we are presented a 4コマ漫画, [_Yonkoma manga_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonkoma)  
All these are happening while the first OST track is playing in the background. Somehow, even though 90% of the scene is just showing a girl at her desk sketching, together with the music, this entire scene just felt so emotional, especially when the title pops up and the climax of the OST hits. _~Feels man_  
Those with keen eyes will see that this scene is the same exact position we see from the album art above. And we come back to this scene multiple times throughout the movie.
